- TensorFlow is a library to train deep learning models and Keras is higher level abstraction on the top of TensorFlow. Keras used to be separate library but from tensorflow 2+ version, keras became part of the tensorflow library. The libraries can be installed using `pip install tensorflow` (for CPU and GPU). However, additional setup is required to integrate TensorFlow with GPU. 
- Neural networks expect an image of a certain size, therefore, we need to provide the image size in `target_size` parameter of the `load_img` function.
- Each image consists of pixel and each of these pixels has the shape of 3 dimensions ***(height, width, color channels)***
- A typical color image consists of three color channels: `red`, `green` and `blue`. Each color channel has 8 bits or 1 byte and can represent distinct values between 0-256 (uint8 type).

**Classes, functions, and methods**:

- `import tensorflow as tf`: to import tensorflow library
- `import tensorflow as keras`: to import keras
- `from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import load_img`: to import load_img function
- `load_img('path/to/image', targe_size=(150,150))`: to load the image of 150 x 150 size in PIL format
- `np.array(img)`: convert image into a numpy array of 3D shape, where each row of the array represents the value of red, green, and blue color channels of one pixel in the image.
